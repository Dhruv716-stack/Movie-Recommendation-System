# Movie-Recommendation-System
A simple and efficient content-based movie recommendation system built using Python. This model suggests movies similar to a user's liked movie by analyzing content features such as genres, overview, cast, and more.
Features:
Content-based filtering using movie metadata
Cosine similarity and TF-IDF for feature comparison
Clean, modular Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks
Lightweight and easy to understand â€“ ideal for learning and experimentation

Tech Stacks:
Python
Pandas & NumPy!
Scikit-learn (preprocessing, cosine similarity)
Jupyter Notebook

How It Works:
The system:
Loads movie metadata (title, genre, overview, etc.)
Converts textual data into vector form using TF-IDF
Computes similarity between movies
Recommends top-N similar movies for a given input

Getting Started:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender
cd movie-recommender
pip install -r requirements.txt
Then open the notebook and start experimenting!
